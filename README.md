How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

* **Graceful degradation is a concept that the basic function of a web still works under environment with very limited sources.**
**Similarly, server worker allows websites to function offline or on poor network connection.**
**Both graceful degradation and server worker focuses on the availability of the web functioning under bad environments.**
**Server worker is a practical method of graceful degradation, and together they can provide more accessible websites.**
